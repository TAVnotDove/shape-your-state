# Shape your State
This is a blog made for people to share the progress they have made <br/>
or the future goals they have on their journey of bettering<br/>
their physical and mental states.

Guests of the blog can view the posts and comments left by other users,<br/>
but need to become Users in order to make a post themselves. 

The users that own the posts and comments they make can edit or delete them.

In order to use it, first you have to clone this git repository.
After that, you need to install the node modules folder with the 
command npm i
And finally, you need to run the npm start command to start the webpage
and the node server command in the server folder to start the server.
